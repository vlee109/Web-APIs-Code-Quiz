# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

Why did you build this project? I build this project as an engaging way to learn and revise the material that we have learnt throughout this bootcamp, using an interactive quiz. 

What did you learn? From this project, I learnt how to incorporate JavaScript code alongside an existing HTML & CSS code outline.
